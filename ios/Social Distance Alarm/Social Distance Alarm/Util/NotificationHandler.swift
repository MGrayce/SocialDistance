/// The iOS app is different from Android.  On Android we use notifications to alert the user that someone may be too close, but
/// iOS doesn't allow enough notifications.  Also iOS doesn't let us do what we need to do in the background.  Because of this
/// we decided that for iOS we would use notifications to let the user know that they app was no longer broadcasting or
/// scanning, so basically any time the app is taken out of the foreground a notification is sent that will let the user bring
/// it back.
